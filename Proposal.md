# Magic Delay
##Sensors:Two Ultrasonic Sensors
**Description:**
This is a musical instrument where two sensors are used to control the parameters of its delay effect. The first sensor, an Ultrasonic Sensor, is employed to adjust the feedback of the delay effect, while the second sensor, also an Ultrasonic Sensor, is utilized to modify the delay time.
 Both sensors respond to changes in gestures, particularly the delay time, which fluctuates in real-time and is represented as a floating-point number (float).
 **Good Outcomeï¼š**
 - One Ultrasonic Sensors Control DelayTime
 - One Ultrasonic Sensors Control DelayFeedback
 - One keyboard to make pad sound
 **Better Outcome:**
 - Use more different sensors to control more differents parameters
 - Use Jitter to have a visual part following
 **Best Outcome**
 - Have a better looking to encapsulate everything
 **Next Steps/ Additional Skiils:**
 To successfully complete this project, in addition to technical skills in electronics and programming, I may require the following additional skills:

***Signal Processing***: Understanding of signal processing concepts will be beneficial for interpreting sensor data and implementing algorithms to manipulate the delay parameters effectively.

***User Experience (UX) Design***: Skills in UX design will help ensure that the interface for interacting with the sensors and controlling the delay parameters is intuitive and user-friendly.

***Prototyping and Rapid Iteration***: Ability to rapidly prototype different sensor configurations and control algorithms will facilitate iterative development and refinement of the system.

***Troubleshooting and Debugging***: Proficiency in troubleshooting hardware and software issues will be essential for diagnosing and resolving any problems that arise during the development process.

***Documentation and Communication**: Strong documentation and communication skills are necessary for documenting the project's progress, writing technical specifications, and communicating effectively with team members and stakeholders.

In terms of research topics, I may consider exploring the following areas:

***Sensor Technologies***: Research different types of sensors beyond ultrasonic sensors that could potentially be used for gesture recognition, such as infrared sensors or capacitive sensors, and evaluate their suitability for the project.

***Gesture Recognition Algorithms***: Investigate gesture recognition algorithms and techniques, such as machine learning-based approaches or template matching algorithms, to accurately interpret hand gestures captured by the sensors.

***Delay Effects and Signal Processing Techniques***: Learn about different types of delay effects used in music production and explore signal processing techniques for implementing these effects, such as digital filtering, delay line algorithms, and feedback control.

***Real-time Audio Processing***: Research real-time audio processing techniques and libraries that can be used to implement the delay effect in a low-latency manner, ensuring smooth and responsive interaction with the instrument.

***Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)***: Study HCI principles and research best practices for designing user interfaces for musical instruments, considering factors such as ergonomics, feedback mechanisms, and user engagement.

***Project Management Methodologies***: Familiarize yourself with project management methodologies such as Agile or Scrum, which can help streamline the development process and ensure timely delivery of the project milestones.

By acquiring these additional skills and conducting thorough research on relevant topics, I can enhance your ability to successfully complete the project and create a compelling sensor-controlled delay system for my musical instrument.
